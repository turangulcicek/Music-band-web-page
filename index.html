        <h1>Deep Purple</h1>
        <p>
            Deep Purple’s last studio album, “Whoosh!” (2020), follows their worldwide chart-topping albums “inFinite” (2017) and “NOW What?!” (2013). For the third time, Deep Purple joined forces with producer Bob Ezrin, who has worked with the likes of KISS, Pink Floyd, Lou Reed and Alice Cooper. In “Whoosh!”, the band and Bob Ezrin created the most versatile album in the history of their collaboration.

            Furthering their collaboration with Ezrin, in 2021 and during the pandemic the band recorded a collection of cover songs from their own homes (normal for most bands nowadays, revolutionary for a band that records everything together in the studio), creating an eclectic and celebratory history of their roots in music, in the shape of ‘Turning To Crime’.
            
            In 2022 came the sad news of Steve Morse’s departure due to personal circumstances, but Deep Purple, never a band to let a set back throw them off course, sought out the masterful skills of guitarist Simon McBride and played the year out in style, exciting crowds with a new energy and excitement.
            
            Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, Don Airey and Simon McBride embark on the year of 2023 with renewed vitality, continuing to push the boundaries of hard rock to audiences around the globe, proving that Deep Purple are very much here to stay.
